# Lesson 6 - Painter:
This is the simple lesson of the Advanced Programming course with the two following objectives: 
* i) Understand about the SDL2 and try to implement by yourself the Painter class for draw simple and beautiful objects.
* ii) Learn automated testing with Github Actions

You are required to implement several functions of Painter class. They could be done via the instructions as follows:
* Step 1: Fork this repo to your own account (Ignore if you did it before)
* Step 2: Clone the forked repo (Ignore if you did it before)
* Step 3: Modify the following functions to complete the requirement.:
	* void Painter::setColor(SDL_Color color);
	* void Painter::jumpForward(int numPixel);
	* void Painter::jumpBackward(int numPixel);
	* void Painter::turnLeft(double degree);
	* void Painter::turnRight(double degree);
	* void Painter::randomColor();
* Step 4: Commit & push the modified file using the command: *git commit -m "[Insert_your_own_message]" & git push origin master*
* Step 5: Create a pull request:
  - In the tab "Pull requests", click on "New pull request"
  - Set the pull request's title with the format as: [Your_student_ID]_[Your_full_name]
  - Click on "Create pull request" to submit
* Step 6: Check the automated testing workflow on your modified code using Github Actions. 
Beside that, you also can see the main.cpp, where there are several drawing beautiful objects's code, and try to build and run this code.
Hope you enjoy the lesson.
