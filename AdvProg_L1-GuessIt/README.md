# Lesson 2: GuessIt:
This is the second lesson of the Advanced Programming course with the following objectives:
* i) Understand about the simplest game source code structure.
* ii) Learn about the automated testing with github Actions.

You are required to implement several functions of GuessIt game. They could be done via the instructions as follows:

* Step 1: Fork this repo to your own account (Ignore if you did it before)
* Step 2: Clone the forked repo (Ignore if you did it before)
* Step 3: Modify the "guessit.cpp" file to complete the requirement. Specifically, there are 6 functions that you have to implement namely:
  - int generateRandomNumber();
  - int getPlayerGuess();
  - string getAnswer(int number, int randomNumber);
  - bool checkSuccess(string answer)
  - bool checkContinuePlaying()
  - char getPlayerOpinion()
* Step 4: Commit & push the modified file using the command: git commit -m "[Insert_your_own_message]" & git push origin master
* Step 5: Create a pull request:
In the tab "Pull requests", click on "New pull request"
Set the pull request's title with the format as: [Your_student_ID]_[Your_full_name]
Click on "Create pull request" to submit
* Step 6: Check the automated testing workflow on your modified code using Github Actions.
Hope you enjoy the lesson.
