# Lesson 0 - Hello:
This is the first-and-simple lesson of the Advanced Programming course with the two following objectives: 
* i) Warm up your C++ skills; 
* ii) Learn automated testing with Github Actions

You are required to implement a function that return the string "Game Over!". 
However, it could be done via the instructions as follows:
* Step 1: Fork this repo to your own account
* Step 2: Clone your forked repo via command: git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/AdvProg_AY2324 
* Step 3: Modify the "hello.cpp" file to complete the requirement. 
* Step 4: Commit & push the modified file using the command: *git commit -m "[Insert_your_own_message]" & git push origin master*
* Step 5: Create a pull request:
  - In the tab "Pull requests", click on "New pull request"
  - Set the pull request's title with the format as: [Your_student_ID]_[Your_full_name]
  - Click on "Create pull request" to submit
* Step 6: Check the automated testing workflow on your modified code using Github Actions. 

Hope you enjoy the lesson.
